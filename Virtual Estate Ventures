The concept of the metaverse, a virtual reality space where users can interact with a computer-generated
environment and other users, has gained significant attention in recent years. 
The metaverse's integration in the real estate development market in Saudi Arabia is still in its nascent
stages. However, the country has shown a growing interest in exploring and leveraging virtual reality technologies
for various industries, including real estate. While specific market size figures for Saudi Arabia are not readily
available, the global virtual reality in real estate market is expected to reach USD 5.34 billion by 2026, with a
CAGR of 33.2% from 2021 to 2026
